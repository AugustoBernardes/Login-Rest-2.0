  Change the file(.env_sample) to .env, and complete using your own data.\
  Nodemon it's not necessary but if you want change the start to (nodemon app.js)\
  And check if you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).\
  The heroku version don't have the token feature because i just added the token here on GitHub heroku version is the oldest version.\
  On userController file at line 36 have this code (res.redirect(`http://localhost:${PORT}/app`)) if you upload this project on heroku or some host
  change the localhost to your URL.
